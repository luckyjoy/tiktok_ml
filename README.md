Classifying Videos Using Machine Learning

### **Classifying Videos Using Machine Learning**

#### **Objective:**
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or "opinion" to help mitigate misinformation on the platform.

#### **Activity Breakdown:**

**Part 1: Ethical Considerations**
- Evaluate the ethical implications of classifying videos as claims or opinions.
- Consider whether the modelâ€™s objective needs adjustment to prevent bias or misclassification.

**Part 2: Feature Engineering**
- Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling. This step involves identifying key features that will help in distinguishing claims from opinions.

**Part 3: Modeling**
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or an "opinion."
- Advise on next steps for improving model accuracy and performance.

#### **Final Deliverable:**
- Complete the activity by addressing the questions in the PACE Strategy Document and summarizing your approach and findings in an Executive Summary.
